WOL Fixed! For me was the Windows settings that fixed the type of shutdown somehow

BIOS...
Make screenshots
Update BIOS
Set settings how they were before update
Set Advanced\APM Configuration\ErP Ready = DISABLED
Set Advanced\APM Configuration\Power on by PCI-E = ENABLED


WINDOWS...
Open Powershell/CMD with ADMIN rights
Run: REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Power" /V HiberbootEnabled /T REG_dWORD /D 0 /F
Open device manager, find your NIC, open, drivers tab - Update driver. If nothing found, download directly from manufacturer website
Once updated, reboot.
After reboot, open NIC properties\Power Management tab:
Tick all boxes - Allow computer to turn off device, allow to wake up, only allow magic packet.
Open NIC properties\Advanced tab and (where available):
Set Enable PME = ENABLED
Set Energy Efficient Ethernet / Green etc = DISABLED
Wake on Magic Packet = ENABLED
Wake on Pattern Match = ENABLED
Reboot, then after reboot shutdown.


You should see the NIC stays enabled and you can boot from WOL packet. Bingo! Only took me 2 days.
For me the solution was updating the drivers and disabling energy efficient mode. Crazy
